## 📥 Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up and run the **Basic App**.

### **1️⃣ Pre-Requisites**
Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)  
- Dart SDK (comes with Flutter)  
- Android Studio/Xcode (for emulators/simulators)  
- Git (for cloning the repository)  

To verify your setup, run:
```bash
flutter doctor
```

### **2️⃣ Clone the Repository**
Open a terminal and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flutter-link-app.git
cd flutter-link-app
```

### **3️⃣ Get Dependencies**
Since we are not using external dependencies, we just need to ensure Flutter recognizes all files:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### **4️⃣ Run the App**
📱 Android Emulator / Physical Device
- Ensure an emulator is running (or connect a physical device via USB).
- Run the app with:
```bash
flutter run
```
🍏 iOS Simulator / Physical Device (Mac Only)
- Ensure Xcode is installed:
```bash
xcode-select --install
```
- Run the app on an iOS simulator:
```bash
flutter run
```
